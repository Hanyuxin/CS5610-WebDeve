The way to run this project is first run server locally, then run PlayYahtzee at least twice. In the PlayYahtzee, it will create a Socket to connect with server, and read server information and console information. To be more user friendly, the UserInputHandler is to process the user information.

The UserInputHandlerTest is to test UserInputHandler class, and simulate the user input from a test file.
The PlayYahtzeeTest is to test to PlayYahtzee class, but if not open Server, it will throw exception
