Problem 4: I create a new project named Assignment1, and a new package also named Assignment1, and then create a new Java Class named RandomHomeWork. In this class, I have a main method and a public class getCources.
Problem 5: I copy the Fibonacci.java in package Assignment1, and create a new package under Assignment1 named test, and then copy the FibonacciTest.java in test.I run FibonacciTest and find 4 problems. I go back to Fibonacci.java to change the n<=0 to n<0, and n<=2 to n<2 and the subtract to plus.
Problem 6: I first write two functions in ReverseNumber, one accept the input from user, another one reverse the Integer.Then, I write three test to test the condition to throw IllegalArgumentException, and one to test the result of reverseNumber.
Problem 7: In Vehicle, in Constructor, I add Exception check and add this to distinguish parameter and variable. And in Test, I test the constructor.
In HighWay, I add two variables to record the number of Vehicle in different direction, which will change in Add method and Remove method, and will simplify the numberVehiclesEastbound and numberVehiclesWestbound. In test, I write 3 tests about the pre-requires of methods, and a test to test the logistic of methods;
In ScenicRoad, I add one variable, highway, to reuse the functions in Highway. And a HashMap to remember the velocity of vehicles so after pass a traffic jam, they can return to their former velocity. Besides, in order to change velocity in Vehicle after over the bendwidth, I add a new method named setVelocity() in Vehicle; And in Test, I test the pre-require that bendwidth can not to non-positive, and the logistic of add and remove.
