##PRESENTATION

Lots of stuttering. You seemed very nervous, and that’s ok! Just remember to take some time to 
practice explaining your code. 

##DESIGN

Minor comment: In the future, please create a folder for your Java classes. 

Fibonacci sequence: very large runtime. Will not handle large numbers well. Did you test large numbers?

Highway: Remember to comment your constructor and/or fields in a meaningful way. For example, 
line 20: what does goEast and goWest represent? Without any context of the code, I don’t know what 
those fields represent. 
(int goEast // represents number of cars heading eastbound.)

HighwayTest.java:
Note from Ian: break JUnit test into meaningful sections. (Which methods are you testing? Are you 
testing an edge case? etc…)

RandomHomeWork.java, ReverseNumber.java, ScenicRoad.java
Comments each method! Look up Javadoc styleguide! This will be important once we start running Maven 
tests on code style!
